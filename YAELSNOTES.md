# ASSIGNING key pairs to dictionaries:
when building a dict i always thought of key value pairs as being “added” in , but thinking about added makes me think about .append() or += when really looping through a key and value assigns those keys and values to the dictionary

# Thinking about loops.. Ansel posed me this question…
where should our default start point be in comparing elements in a list (in this case every string was added to the list because it is “Worth” the same value) i kept saying… shortest?
until ansel said: think about this… does it matter?
well no… IT DOESNT MATTER
so if it doesnt matter… and if we had thousands of words to check.. what would be the best approach?

and suddenly the answer clicked… THE BEGINNING!

so i have a loop… for x in my list…
i think i had a major comprehnesion issue with x in this situation, x moves from index to index, but i tend to think of x as holding the index, but x is actually holding the VALUE in the index, a visual helped me with this

# Demystifying comparisons
when trying to do, “a lot” of comparisons… they really whittle down into three categories:
bigger
smaller
the same !
